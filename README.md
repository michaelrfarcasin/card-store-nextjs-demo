A small project completed in ~30 hours to showcase my frontend development abilities.

This was my first time using next.js, react-dropdown, swr, and babel.

It's also the first React app I've built starting from a blank page.

I initialized the project with:

```
npx create-next-app@latest
```

I was given the following to build off of:
- the contents of /pages/api/
- /common/data.ts
- /common/types.ts
- /styles/globals.css
- some of the styles in /styles/Home.module.css
- a wireframe for what the final product should look like

I've made some changes to those files to obscure the source.

I built:
- /common/context/
- /common/helper/
- /common/apiGet.ts
- /modules/
- the rest of /styles/
